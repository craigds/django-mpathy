mpathy is a Materialised Path implementation for django. Use it for storing hierarchical data in your postgres database,
and accessing it from Django.

It is a fairly thin wrapper around Postgres' [ltree extension](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ltree.html)

# Why

There are a few existing ways to store trees in databases via Django. The main two libraries are:

* django-mptt (implementation of MPTT / "nested sets")
* django-treebeard (multi-backend tree storage app)

While both are good and widely used, both suffer from a large amount of complexity, both in implementation and interface.

The need to support multiple database backends, as well as the lack of well-indexed database tree implementations at the time they were created, has made both projects overly complex.

Both apps, by necessity, put the tree consistency logic in the app layer. That's tricky (maybe impossible!) to get right, and has caused many tree consistency bugs in threaded environments.

Mpathy delegates consistency to the database where it belongs. We use Postgres constraints to ensure that the tree fields are consistent ~~at all times~~ whenever changes are committed.

# Requirements

* Any supported version of django and python
* psycopg2 2.7+
* Postgres

# Goals

mpathy intends to:
 * only support Postgres. I have no interest in supporting MySQL.
 * only support materialised path. The other implementations are too complicated, and the benefits are fairly small.
 * Push most of the work into the database to ensure performance and consistency.
 * Leverage modern django and postgres features to keep the code tidy and performant.
